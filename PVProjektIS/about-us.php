		<p>Turing was born in Maida Vale, London.</p>
		<p>Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at Kings College, Cambridge, where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics.</p>
		<p>During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said, "You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley and Turings was that genius."</p>
		<p>From September 1938, Turing worked part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), the British codebreaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher machine used by Nazi Germany, together with Dilly Knox, a senior GC&CS codebreaker.</p>
		<p>By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process, Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches, titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptographyand Paper on Statistics of Repetitions,which were of such value to GC&CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012, shortly before the centenary of his birth.</p>
		<p>Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park,Turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the bombe, which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba kryptologiczna, from which its name was derived.</p>
		<p>Between 1945 and 1947, Turing lived in Hampton, London,while he worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a stored-program computer.Von Neumanns incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turings paper, but it was much less detailed and, according to John R. Womersley, Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division, it "contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turings own".</p>
